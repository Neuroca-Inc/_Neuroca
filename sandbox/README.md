## Memory System

### Three-Tier Architecture

- **STM (Short-Term Memory)**: Working memory for immediate context
- **MTM (Medium-Term Memory)**: Intermediate consolidation layer
- **LTM (Long-Term Memory)**: Permanent semantic storage with relationships

### Memory Operations

- **Store**: Add new memories with rich metadata
- **Retrieve**: Get specific memories by ID
- **Search**: Find relevant memories across all tiers
- **Consolidate**: Move memories between tiers based on importance

## Cognitive Control Components

### Attention Manager

- Focus management for incoming stimuli
- Context-aware attention allocation
- Attention state tracking

### Goal Manager

- Dynamic goal setting and tracking
- Priority-based goal management
- Goal-driven behavior
