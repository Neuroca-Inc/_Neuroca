### Response Inhibition
- **Prepotent Suppression**: Suppresses dominant or automatic responses
- **Action Cancellation**: Stops actions that have been initiated
- **Response Delay**: Introduces a delay before responding to allow for evaluation
- **Action Selection Filter**: Filters out inappropriate actions from the selection process

### Distractor Suppression
- **Salience Filtering**: Reduces the impact of salient but irrelevant stimuli
- **Noise Reduction**: Filters out background noise in sensory and cognitive processing
- **Relevance Filter**: Allows only contextually relevant information to pass through
- **Focus Protection**: Maintains attention on the current task by suppressing distractions

### Interference Control
- **Cross-Talk Prevention**: Prevents interference between concurrent processes
- **Context Protection**: Maintains the integrity of contextual information
- **Memory Interference Control**: Manages interference between memory items
- **Process Isolation**: Ensures isolation between cognitive processes that might interfere

### Prepotent Inhibition
- **Habit Override**: Overrides habitual responses in favor of goal-directed behavior
- **Automatic Response Control**: Regulates automatic responses based on context
- **Default Override**: Suppresses default behaviors when they are inappropriate
- **Pattern Interrupt**: Breaks established patterns of thinking or behavior

### Cognitive Suppression
- **Thought Suppression**: Inhibits intrusive or irrelevant thoughts
- **Memory Suppression**: Temporarily inhibits memory retrieval when it would interfere
- **Concept Inhibition**: Suppresses activation of concepts that are not contextually relevant
- **Association Blocking**: Blocks inappropriate associations between concepts

### Emotional Regulation
- **Emotion Suppression**: Dampens emotional responses when they would interfere with cognition
- **Affective Control**: Regulates the influence of affect on cognitive processes
- **Emotional Bias Reduction**: Reduces biases introduced by emotional states
- **Emotion Reappraisal**: Reframes emotional reactions to change their impact

The Inhibition System is closely linked to the Executive Function system, which directs inhibitory control, and the Attention System, which works in tandem with Distractor Suppression to maintain focus. Inhibition is a critical function in cognitive control, allowing for flexible, goal-directed behavior by suppressing inappropriate responses and irrelevant information.'''

This system forms a higher level of cognitive control, providing a supervisory function that monitors, evaluates, and regulates the cognitive architecture's operations. Through metacognition, the system can improve performance over time, adapt to new situations, and develop self-awareness of its own processing.'''

### In-Memory Backend
- **RAM Storage**: Stores data directly in system memory.
- **Dictionary Store**: Often implemented using Python dictionaries.
- **Volatile Nature**: Data is lost when the system restarts unless persistence is separately managed.
- **Fast Access**: Provides the fastest access speeds. Suitable for Working Memory.

### SQLite Backend
- **File-based Database**: Stores data in a local file.
- **SQL Operations**: Uses standard SQL for data manipulation.
- **Schema Management**: Defines table structures for memory items.
- **DB Indexing**: Uses database indexes for faster querying. Suitable for persistent storage on single nodes.

### Redis Backend
- **Key-Value Store**: Stores data primarily as key-value pairs.
- **Caching Layer**: Can be used as a fast cache in front of other backends.
- **Persistence Options**: Offers configurable persistence mechanisms (RDB, AOF).
- **Redis Data Structures**: Leverages Redis's advanced data structures (hashes, lists, sets). Suitable for distributed caching or session storage.

### Vector Storage Backend
- **Vector Database**: Specialized database for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (e.g., LanceDB, Milvus, Pinecone).
- **Similarity Search**: Enables efficient searching based on vector similarity (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product).
- **Embedding Storage**: Stores vector embeddings generated from memory content.
- **Vector Indexing**: Uses specialized indexing techniques (e.g., HNSW, IVF) for fast vector search. Crucial for Semantic Memory retrieval based on meaning.'''

### Maintenance Scheduler
- Orchestrates the execution of cleaning, pruning, maintenance, and repair tasks, often during periods of low cognitive load (simulated "sleep").

### Memory Cleaning
- **Obsolete Detection**: Identifies memory items that are no longer valid or relevant.
- **Redundancy Check**: Finds and marks duplicate or redundant information.
- **Irrelevance Marking**: Flags items that have become irrelevant based on current goals or context.
- **Decay Application**: Applies decay mechanisms to reduce the strength or salience of unused items.

### Memory Pruning
- **Weak Link Removal**: Removes weak connections between memory items.
- **Low Importance Removal**: Deletes items deemed unimportant based on metadata or usage.
- **Age-Based Pruning**: Removes old items that haven't been accessed recently (configurable).
- **Capacity Management**: Prunes items to stay within storage capacity limits.

### Health Maintenance
- **Integrity Check**: Verifies the structural integrity of memory data.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensures consistency across related memory items and indexes.
- **Index Rebuild**: Rebuilds search indexes for optimal performance.
- **Statistics Update**: Updates metadata and statistics about memory usage.

### Memory Repair
- **Corruption Detection**: Identifies corrupted or damaged memory data.
- **Data Recovery**: Attempts to recover data from backups or redundant sources.
- **Link Reconstruction**: Tries to repair broken links between memory items.
- **Error Correction**: Corrects errors in memory content where possible.

The Lymphatic System is triggered by the Memory Manager, potentially influenced by the Health System's state (e.g., running more intensively during low-load periods). Its goal is to prevent memory clutter, maintain performance, and ensure data integrity.'''

### Main Data Flow
- **External Input**: Information entering the system from external sources
- **API Layer**: Entry and exit point for external interactions
- **Input Processing**: Initial processing of incoming information
- **Memory System**: Storage and retrieval of information in the three-tiered memory
- **Cognitive System**: Core cognitive processing components
- **Reasoning Engine**: Applies reasoning methods to information
- **Decision Making**: Makes decisions based on reasoning and goals
- **Action Selection**: Selects actions based on decisions
- **Output Formation**: Formats the selected actions for output
- **External Output**: Information leaving the system to external recipients

### Memory Flows
- Information flows between the Memory System and its three tiers: Working Memory, Episodic Memory, and Semantic Memory
- Each tier has different storage characteristics and retrieval patterns

### LLM Integration Flows
- The LLM Integration component receives processed input
- It provides processed information to both the Semantic Memory and Cognitive System
- This enables embeddings for memory storage and semantic understanding for reasoning

### Health System Flows
- The Health System monitors and regulates both the Cognitive System and Memory System
- It receives feedback from the Cognitive System to update health metrics
- This creates a feedback loop that maintains system health and performance

The flow architecture ensures that information is processed in a structured way, moving from input through processing and memory systems, to cognitive components, and finally to output, with health monitoring throughout.'''
