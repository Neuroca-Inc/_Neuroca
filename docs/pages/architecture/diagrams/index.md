# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) Diagrams

This directory contains architectural diagrams of the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) system at different levels of abstraction.

## System-Level Diagrams

- [High-Level System Architecture](./system-architecture.md) - Overview of the complete NCA system

## Component Architectures

- [Memory System Architecture](./memory-system/index.md) - The three-tiered memory system architecture
- [Health System Architecture](./health-system/index.md) - Health monitoring and dynamics system
- [Cognitive Control Architecture](./cognitive-control/index.md) - Attention, reasoning, and metacognition
- [Integration Architecture](./integration/index.md) - Integration with external systems (LangChain, etc.)

## Cross-Component Diagrams

- [Data Flow Diagrams](./data-flow/index.md) - Data flow between major components
- [Infrastructure Architecture](./infrastructure/index.md) - Deployment and infrastructure

Each diagram provides progressively more detailed views of the system components.
