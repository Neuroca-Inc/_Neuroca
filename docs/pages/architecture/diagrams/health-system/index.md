# Health System Architecture

This directory contains diagrams of the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) health system at different levels of detail.

## Overview Diagrams

- [Health System Overview](./overview.md) - High-level view of the health system components
- [Health Monitoring Architecture](./components/monitoring.md) - Detailed view of the health monitoring subsystem
- [Health Dynamics](./components/dynamics.md) - Health state transitions and regulation mechanisms

## Component-Level Diagrams

- [Health Component Registry](./components/registry.md) - Health component registration and management

The health system is a core component of the NeuroCognitive Architecture, providing biologically-inspired mechanisms for monitoring and regulating the system's operational state.
