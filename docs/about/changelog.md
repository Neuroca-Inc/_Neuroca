# Project Changelog

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is currently in an **active alpha** phase (see the project status section in the main documentation index). The public API surface, memory configuration options, and cognitive/health subsystems are still evolving, and breaking changes may occur between minor versions until a stable `1.0.0` contract is declared.

Formal, versioned release notes (including migration guidance and compatibility details) will be maintained in the published documentation site and in GitHub Releases once versioned milestones are cut.

## Where to find change history today

Until a stable release series is established, the most accurate view of how the system is changing is provided by:

- The Git commit history of this repository.
- The architecture and design documents under `docs/architecture/`.
- The development and testing documentation under `docs/development/` and `docs/operations/`.

These sources reflect the current implementation more reliably than a hand-maintained static list of historical versions.

## Legacy and experimental branches

Historical details for earlier experimental branches and prototypes remain available in the Git history and any associated GitHub releases. Those snapshots may not reflect the current APIs, recommended deployment patterns, or supported backends, and should be treated as archival rather than canonical guidance.
