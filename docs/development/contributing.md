## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](../community/code_of_conduct.md).

## Getting Started

### Project Setup

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the main repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/neuroca.git
   cd neuroca
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-org/neuroca.git
   ```

### Development Environment

1. **Install dependencies**:
   We use Poetry for dependency management:
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry if you don't have it
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # Install dependencies with dev/test extras
   poetry install --with dev,test
   ```

2. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

4. **Docker environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production
- `release/*`: Release preparation

Always create new branches from `develop` unless you're working on a hotfix.

### Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear and structured commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat(memory): implement working memory decay function

Add time-based decay to working memory items based on the
forgetting curve algorithm.

Closes #123
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a focused PR**: Each PR should address a single concern.
2. **Update documentation**: Include updates to relevant documentation.
3. **Add tests**: Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
4. **Ensure CI passes**: All tests, linting, and other checks must pass.
5. **Request review**: Assign reviewers once your PR is ready.
6. **Address feedback**: Respond to all review comments and make necessary changes.
7. **Squash commits**: Before merging, squash commits into logical units.

## Package Building and Distribution

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is distributed as a Python package. This section provides guidelines for building, testing, and publishing the package.

### Building the Package

We use Poetry for package management and building:

```bash
# Ensure your poetry.toml and pyproject.toml are properly configured
# Increment version in pyproject.toml according to semantic versioning

# Build the package (creates both wheel and sdist)
poetry build
```

Alternatively, you can use the standard Python build tools:

```bash
# Install build if not already installed
pip install build

# Build the package
python -m build
```

This will create distribution packages in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing Installation

Before publishing, test the installation of your package locally:

```bash
# Create a temporary virtual environment
python -m venv .venv-test-pkg

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\.venv-test-pkg\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/MacOS:
source .venv-test-pkg/bin/activate

# Install the package from the local build
pip install dist/*.whl  # or dist/*.tar.gz for the source distribution

# Test basic import
python -c "import neuroca; print('Successfully imported neuroca')"

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### Publishing to PyPI

Only maintainers with appropriate permissions should publish to PyPI:

```bash
# Ensure you have TestPyPI and PyPI credentials configured
# First, test with TestPyPI
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
poetry publish --repository testpypi

# If everything looks good on TestPyPI, publish to PyPI
poetry publish

# Alternatively, using twine
pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
```

Remember to create a Git tag for each published version:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications.
- Maximum line length is 100 characters.
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.

We use the following tools to enforce standards:
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for linting
- mypy for type checking

### Documentation Guidelines

- Use [Google-style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- Document all public APIs, classes, and functions.
- Include examples in docstrings where appropriate.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
- Add inline comments for complex logic.

Example:
```python
def process_memory_item(item: MemoryItem, decay_factor: float = 0.5) -> MemoryItem:
    """
    Process a memory item with decay based on time elapsed.
    
    Args:
        item: The memory item to process
        decay_factor: Factor controlling decay rate (0.0-1.0)
        
    Returns:
        Processed memory item with updated activation
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If decay_factor is outside valid range
    
    Example:
        >>> item = MemoryItem(content="test", activation=1.0, timestamp=time.time()-3600)
        >>> processed = process_memory_item(item)
        >>> processed.activation < 1.0
        True
    """
```

### Testing Requirements

- All new code should have corresponding tests.
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code.
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and where appropriate, end-to-end tests.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.
- Use pytest for writing and running tests.

## Architecture Guidelines

- Follow the domain-driven design principles established in the project.
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers.
- Respect the three-tiered memory system architecture.
- Use dependency injection to make components testable.
- Follow the SOLID principles.
- Document architectural decisions that deviate from the established patterns.

## Review Process

- All code changes require at least one review before merging.
- Reviewers should check for:
  - Correctness
  - Test coverage
  - Code quality and style
  - Documentation
  - Performance considerations
  - Security implications
- Be respectful and constructive in reviews.
- Address all review comments before requesting re-review.
