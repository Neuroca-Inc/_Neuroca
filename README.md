<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is an advanced framework designed to imbue Large Language Models (LLMs) with more sophisticated, human-like cognitive capabilities. It transcends standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by replacing fixed context windows and explicit retrieval calls with a <strong>dynamic, multi-tiered memory system</strong> inspired by biological cognition. This organic system allows the LLM's effective context to grow and adapt indefinitely, fostering accurate, stable, and long-term conversational understanding. Memory management—including consolidation, decay, and relevance scoring—operates automatically in the background. This enables the LLM to genuinely <strong>learn and evolve</strong> from interactions, "experiencing" its memories organically rather than relying on external tools to fetch isolated data points.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Multi-Tiered Memory System**: Unlike flat vector databases used in typical RAG, NCA features a structured memory hierarchy inspired by human cognition:
    - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: High-speed, temporary storage for immediate context (akin to working memory). Governed by TTL (Time-To-Live).
    - **Medium-Term Memory (MTM)**: Intermediate storage for recently relevant information, acting as a buffer before long-term consolidation. Managed by capacity limits and decay.
    - **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Persistent storage for consolidated knowledge and core facts. Supports efficient retrieval over large datasets.
- **Biologically-Inspired Processes**:
    - **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic background process to move important memories from STM -> MTM -> LTM based on relevance, frequency, and importance scores.
    - **Memory Decay**: Memories naturally lose relevance over time unless reinforced, mimicking forgetting and keeping the memory system focused.
    - **Importance Scoring**: Allows explicit weighting of memories, influencing retrieval and consolidation priority.
- **Rich Memory Representation**: Stores not just content embeddings but also crucial metadata like timestamps, sources, tags, and importance scores, enabling more complex querying and context association.
- **Dynamically Managed Backends**: The system automatically selects and manages the optimal storage backend (e.g., high-speed In-Memory for STM, persistent SQLite/Vector DBs for MTM/LTM) for each memory tier based on configuration. This happens transparently, ensuring the best balance of speed, persistence, and scalability for different types of memory without manual intervention. The architecture is designed for easy extension with new backend types.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Goes beyond simple vector similarity to allow filtering and searching based on metadata, time, importance, and tags across different memory tiers.
- **Thread-Safe Design**: Engineered for robust performance in asynchronous applications with thread-local connection management for database backends.
- **Organic Learning & Context**: Facilitates true learning and adaptation by allowing the LLM's effective context to grow organically and potentially indefinitely. Unlike RAG's manual retrieval, NCA's automatic background processes provide context seamlessly. This enables the LLM to evolve its understanding over time based on its "experiences"—remembering not just facts, but also past interactions, mistakes made, recent documentation changes, version updates, and other crucial context—without explicit tool intervention.

## NCA vs. Standard RAG: A Deeper Dive

While standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by fetching external data, NCA offers a fundamentally more dynamic and integrated approach to memory and context:

| Feature             | Standard RAG                                     | NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA)                                     | Example Advantage                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Structure** | Typically a flat vector database.                | Multi-tiered (STM, MTM, LTM) mimicking cognitive processes.           | NCA can prioritize recent info (STM) while retaining core knowledge (LTM), unlike a single-pool vector DB.       |
| **Context Handling** | Relies on fixed context windows & explicit retrieval calls. | Context grows organically; relevant memories surface automatically. | NCA avoids abrupt context loss; past relevant details (e.g., user preferences) remain accessible indefinitely. |
| **Info Lifecycle**   | Data is often static until manually updated.     | Memories consolidate, decay, and are updated based on interactions. | In NCA, outdated information naturally fades, while frequently used info strengthens, keeping context relevant. |
| **Retrieval**       | Primarily vector similarity search.              | Multi-faceted search (similarity, metadata, time, importance, tags).  | NCA can find memories "from last Tuesday about Project X" not just semantically similar text.                  |
| **Learning**        | Limited to the static data retrieved.            | Learns implicitly through memory dynamics and consolidation.          | NCA adapts its knowledge base over time based on ongoing interactions, reflecting genuine learning.            |
| **Integration**     | Often requires separate tool calls for retrieval. | Memory management (incl. backend selection) is integrated; context provided seamlessly. | LLM interacts more naturally with NCA, as memory (across dynamically managed backends) feels intrinsic. |

In essence, where standard RAG bolts on an external database, NCA integrates a dynamic, self-maintaining cognitive memory system, enabling LLMs to develop a more persistent, adaptive, and nuanced understanding of context over time.

## Example Use Cases

NCA's advanced memory capabilities unlock potential for applications beyond the scope of simpler RAG systems:

- **Truly Stateful Conversational Agents**: Build chatbots and virtual assistants that maintain coherent, long-term memory of user preferences, past interactions, and evolving goals across multiple sessions.
- **Personalized Adaptive Learning**: Create educational tools that track a student's knowledge progression, remembering areas of difficulty and tailoring content accordingly.
- **Complex Task Automation & Planning**: Develop agents that can perform multi-step tasks, remembering previous actions, outcomes, and environmental state changes to inform future decisions.
- **Creative Writing Assistants**: Aid writers by maintaining consistent character details, plot points, and world-building elements across long narratives.
- **Cognitive Science Research**: Provide a platform for simulating and experimenting with different memory models and cognitive architectures.
